# Employee Performance Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an employee performance dataset (\~4000 records)
using Python and statistics concepts. The goal is to explore employee
performance patterns and predict promotion probability.

## 📂 Dataset Columns

-   Employee_ID
-   Department
-   Age
-   Salary
-   Projects_Completed
-   Working_Hours
-   Performance_Score
-   Promotion_Status

## 🧠 Part A -- Theory Topics

-   Mean, Median, Mode
-   Range & Variance
-   Normal vs Poisson Distribution
-   Skewness
-   Conditional Probability
-   Independent vs Mutually Exclusive Events
-   Bayes Theorem
-   PCA

## 💻 Part B -- Practical Tasks

1.  Central Tendency & Dispersion
2.  Probability & Contingency Tables
3.  Distributions & Visualization
4.  Linear Algebra Applications

## 📊 Key Insights

-   High performance employees have higher promotion probability.
-   Salary distribution may be skewed.
-   Performance scores follow near-normal distribution.
-   Department-wise promotion differences exist.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Open Google Colab.
2.  Upload `employee_performance.csv`.
3.  Run notebook cells sequentially.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
